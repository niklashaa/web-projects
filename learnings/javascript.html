    Object: Collection of name value pairs
    There is always a global object (Window in the browser)
    Global = Not inside a function
    Variables and functions get attached to the global object
    Hoisting: Setup memory space for variables and functions (Before the code is actually executed)
      Functions are hoisted completely
      Variables just get "undefined as a placeholder
    Never set a variable to undefined!
      It would be hard to tell who set it to undefined, you or the engine
    Invocate a function with paranthesis()
    Every execution context has a reference to its outer context
      Is defined where the function sits lexically 
    Asynchronous callbacks are possible because the browser can execute stuff
    in parallel to the JS script being executed

    Primitive type: A type of data that represents a single value (not an object):
    - undefined
    - null
    - boolean
    - number (floating point)
    - string
    - symbol

    Operator precedence: Determines which operator gets executed first
    Associativity: Determines which operator gets executed first when all have the same precedence

    Dynamic typing: JS engine decides on the type of a parameter at runtime
    Coercion: Converting a value from one type to another

    To-Do:
      First Class Functions
      Callbacks
      Closures
      IIFEs
      call, apply, bind
      Protoypal inheritance
      Function constructors
      Object.create
      Classes
